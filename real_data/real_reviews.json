    "As a freelancer, I work with multiple clients at the same time. Managing multiple tasks and ensuring that proper tracking is done is not easy. This is where Asana helps a great deal. It allowed not only to ensure that the project is shared with the respected team members, but also helped me to track the status well. Starting from the allotment to when the task is in progress to completion, it helped me to keep track of every step with ease. The best part was the ability to curate different projects and tasks at the same time. Another helpful feature was the automation. I was not required to constantly check if there was a new allotment or anything. The automates messages and emails ensured that everything was done in time and there were no delays. This helped streamline actions and smooth the entire day's tasks. I was able to integrate it with the existing doc system and clients as well. In fact, when I started using this, I found it very simple to use with no deep tech points that hinder the implementation. I have been using this for almost 2 years now, and I am really happy. Also, the support for any issue was seamless.",

    "I think once the templates are set up, they're pretty easy to use. I also like being able to have a portfolio that has all of our projects for that year in it to more easily look across projects. The templates allow us to track progress on projects and really customize it to our company's specific flow for different conditions. So we have about 10 different common project types that all have slightly different flows, and I'm able to capture that accurately and relevantly with those templates. The portfolio allows us to see key details from a 30,000-foot view of all of our projects, including things like the project name, who's assigned to it, when it's launching, progress, and project type.",
